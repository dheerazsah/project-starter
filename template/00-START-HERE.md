# Start here: the project starter

A set of Markdown files that turns an empty folder into a production-ready project on Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (Base UI), with a Hono API on Cloudflare Workers, a full design system, the docs set, and a team of Claude Code agents that already know the conventions.

**Laid out as the new repo will be.** Everything in this folder (the starter's `template/`) is already at the path it keeps in the new project, so there's nothing to move. The files contain no machine-specific paths and link to each other relative to those paths.

## How to use them in a new project

1. Create an empty folder for the project and open it in the IDE.
2. Copy **everything inside** the starter's `template/` folder into it, including the hidden `.claude/` folder. From a clone of the starter: `cp -R project-starter/template/. my-app/`.
3. Ask Claude Code: **"Set up the project from SETUP.md"**. It will:
   - scaffold and configure the app by following `SETUP.md` step by step (including the `.github/` files from `GITHUB_TEMPLATES.md`),
   - run the verify step (install, typecheck, lint, React Doctor, test, build) and report.
4. Fill in the placeholders (table below) with the owner; that's roadmap task M0-1.
5. Delete `00-START-HERE.md`, `SETUP.md` and `GITHUB_TEMPLATES.md` from the repo afterwards; the starter repo keeps the originals for the next project.

### What's where

The agent files carry their frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`), so they work as soon as they're in `.claude/agents/`; each file name (without `.md`) must match its `name`.

## Placeholders

Replace these after setup (find what's left with `grep -rnE "\{\{[A-Z0-9_]+\}\}" --exclude-dir=node_modules .`):

| Placeholder | Where | What to put |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}` | `package.json` `name`, `wrangler.jsonc` `name` and resources, `src/lib/app.ts` (`STORAGE_PREFIX`), docs | The project slug, lowercase kebab-case, e.g. `team-planner` |

| `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` | `index.html` | One line for the meta description |
| `{{ONE_PARAGRAPH_SUMMARY}}`, `{{ONE_LINE_SUMMARY}}`, `{{ROLES}}`, `{{SECTIONS}}` | `CLAUDE.md`, agents | What the app does, its roles and sections |
| `{{BRAND_COLOR}}` | `src/index.css` (every value marked `BRAND`), `index.html` (`theme-color`), `public/favicon.svg`, `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` | The brand colour; in CSS as oklch |
| `{{BRAND_PALETTE}}`, `{{FONT}}`, `{{CONTRAST_TABLE}}`, `{{GLOSSARY}}` | `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `src/index.css` (`--font-sans`) | Brand colours, UI font, measured contrast, one word per concept |
| `{{LOGO}}` | `public/favicon.svg`, `public/brand/`, `src/components/app-shell.tsx` (`HomeLink`) | Logo and mark (with a dark-mode version) |
| `{{LIVE_URL}}`, `{{GITHUB_REPO}}`, `{{OWNER_NAME}}` | `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/GUIDE.md`, `docs/DEPLOY_AND_CI.md`, agents | Live URL, `org/repo`, the maintainer |
| `{{AUTH_APPROACH}}` | `.claude/agents/backend-developer.md` | How people sign in (see `docs/SECURITY.md` §1) |
| `{{EMAIL_DOMAIN}}` | `docs/ENV_AND_SECRETS.md` | The email domain allowed to sign up, if signup is limited |
| `{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}` | `.github/CODEOWNERS` (from `GITHUB_TEMPLATES.md`) | The owner's GitHub handle, without `@` |
| `{{ORG}}`, `{{TOPICS}}` | `docs/AI_FEATURES.md` prompts | The organisation and what the assistant answers about |
| `{{D1_DATABASE_ID}}` | `wrangler.jsonc` | Only once D1 is turned on |
| `{{DATE}}`, `{{GOAL_1}}`, `{{FEATURE}}`, `{{TACTIC_1}}`, `{{JOURNEY_NAME}}` and the rest | `docs/GUIDE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/RESEARCH.md` | The product, goals, features, journeys and plan (the templates explain each) |

The branch prefix `dksk/` is the maintainer's initials. Another maintainer can swap it in every file with one search and replace (`dksk/` → `<initials>/`) before setup.

## Finding the right doc, agent or skill

After setup, `CLAUDE.md` has a **"Where to look for each objective"** table: for each kind of work (plan, research, design, expressive pages, front end, API, AI, QA, deploy, credits, diagrams and video, SEO, compliance) it names the docs to read, the agents to use, and any skills, plugins or libraries, with the cheapest-first order for finding a skill.

## Conventions these files carry

- Branches `dksk/<type>/<name>`; one commit per task, each one typechecks. No commit, push, deploy, remote migration, secret change or local data reset without the owner.
- One build agent at a time; every build ends with `code-reviewer`, and UI builds with `ux-reviewer` and `qa-tester`.
- Status lives only in `ROADMAP.md` (status column right after #); `GUIDE.md` is reference.
- The UI principles and UX laws in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` are followed on every screen, checked with the §23 checklist. Big UI work starts with research (`RESEARCH.md`).
- Seed and demo data come from real public content, never invented; demo deployments have a pre-filled account per role; `DEMO_MODE` is off in production.
- Check every UI change at phone, tablet and desktop, light and dark, with no console errors.
- Quality first; cut wasted credits, not quality. Never PNG: text checks first, then at most a few JPEGs (quality 60, CSS scale).
- Keep every shadcn component and brand file, even unused ones. Buttons have 10 px corners and `font-medium`, never pills; theme tokens only.
