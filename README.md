# Project starter

A set of flat Markdown files that turns an empty folder into a production-ready, agent-run web app: **Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui (Base UI)** on the front end, a **Hono API on Cloudflare Workers** (with D1, R2, KV, Durable Objects and Claude when needed) on the back end, a full design system with UI principles and UX laws, the docs set, and a team of **Claude Code agents** that already know the conventions.

No code generator and no template repo to fork: paste the files, ask Claude Code to "set up the project from SETUP.md", and it scaffolds, configures and verifies the app.

## Quick start

1. Create an empty folder and open it in your editor with Claude Code.
2. Copy in every `.md` file from this repo **except** `README.md`, `LICENSE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (those describe the starter itself).
3. Ask Claude Code: **"Set up the project from SETUP.md"**. It moves each file into place, scaffolds the app, writes the `.github/` templates, and runs install, typecheck, lint, React Doctor, test and build.
4. Fill in the placeholders with the owner (roadmap task M0-1); the list is in [`00-START-HERE.md`](./00-START-HERE.md#placeholders).
5. Delete `00-START-HERE.md`, `SETUP.md` and `GITHUB_TEMPLATES.md` from the new repo.

Needs Node 22+, pnpm 10+, and a Cloudflare account for the first deploy.

## Find what you need

Every doc has one job (table above). To go from a goal to the right doc, agent, skill or plugin ("design a screen", "add AI features", "get found on Google", "tokens keep running out"), use the **"Where to look for each objective"** table in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#where-to-look-for-each-objective). It also gives the order for finding skills: what's already there first, then single Vercel skills read through `skills-scout`, then one community plugin from [`CLAUDE_PLUGINS.md`](./CLAUDE_PLUGINS.md), always with the owner's OK.

Two docs wait for a specific moment: [`SEO_AND_DISCOVERABILITY.md`](./SEO_AND_DISCOVERABILITY.md) at launch (plus two early decisions) and [`PRE_LAUNCH_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`](./PRE_LAUNCH_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md) at the end of production.

## How the team works

One build agent at a time: plan → (research) → design → build → code review → UX review → QA → roadmap update. The owner approves everything that leaves the laptop: commits, pushes, deploys, remote migrations, secrets and local data resets. Details in [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md).

## Contributing

Changes to the starter go through a PR. Keep the files flat, self-contained (no absolute paths, no links outside the set) and free of any one project's names. If you change a code block in `SETUP.md`, run the whole recipe in an empty folder and the verify step before merging. Record every change in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).
