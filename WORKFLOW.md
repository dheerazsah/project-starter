# Workflow

How work moves through the team of Claude Code agents (`.claude/agents/`), what the owner decides, and how status stays in one place. Short version: **one build task at a time; plan → cost plan → design → build → review → QA → roadmap update; the owner approves everything that leaves the laptop.**

## 1. The team

| Agent | Does | Edits code? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `project-manager` | Turns requests into ordered tasks with owners; keeps `GUIDE.md` and `ROADMAP.md` current; branch names and PR text | Docs only |
| `credits-optimizer` | Before a task: which agent and model, a tight brief, the checks. After: where credits were wasted | No |
| `product-designer` | Brief, user flow, scope, then screens; owns `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`; WCAG 2.2 AA and the UX laws | Visual changes |
| `developer` | Front end in `src/` | Yes |
| `backend-developer` | Worker API, D1, R2, sign-in, AI calls in `worker/`, `migrations/`, `shared/` | Yes |
| `ux-reviewer` | Audits screens and flows against the UI principles, UX laws and the §23 checklist in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` | No |
| `code-reviewer` | Reviews the diff for bugs, security, conventions, design-system drift | No |
| `qa-tester` | Tests in a real browser: widths, themes, keyboard, axe, console | No |
| `devops` | Builds, CI, environments, secrets, deploys (asks before production) | Config |

## 2. The loop for one task

```text
owner request
  → project-manager      plan: tasks in order, one owner each, decisions for the owner, row in ROADMAP
  → credits-optimizer    cost plan for big or risky tasks: agent + model, 3–8 files to read, criteria, checks
  → product-designer     big UI work (new section, core flow, redesign): research first (docs/RESEARCH.md)
  → product-designer     if the task has UI: brief → user flow → scope → screens (before any code)
  → developer / backend-developer    build (ONE build agent at a time)
  → code-reviewer        the diff: Blocker / Should fix / Nit  → fixes by the builder
  → ux-reviewer          UI changes: §1, §3 and the §23 checklist  → fixes by the builder
  → qa-tester            UI changes: browser at 5 widths, light/dark, keyboard, axe, console
  → project-manager      ROADMAP: ✅, dashboard, log line; GUIDE only if behaviour changed
  → owner                approves the commit (and later the PR, migration, deploy)
```

- **One build agent at a time**, top to bottom in the roadmap's queue. The next build starts only after the current one passes review and QA.
- `ux-reviewer` and `code-reviewer` are read-only, so they can run side by side after a build; fixes go back to the one builder.
- Backend-only tasks skip design, `ux-reviewer` and browser QA, but not `code-reviewer` and tests.
- New requests go to the end of the queue unless the owner says otherwise.
- A task is done when its "Done when" criteria in `ROADMAP.md` are met, all checks pass, and the roadmap is updated.

## 3. What the owner approves

Agents suggest the exact commands; the owner says go:

- Commits, pushes, PRs and merges.
- Deploys (production and demo), rollbacks.
- Remote migrations (after a backup), production data changes, resetting local data (`rm -rf .wrangler/state`, re-seeding).
- Secrets: adding, rotating, removing.
- New dependencies, and turning on a new paid service or Cloudflare resource.
- Anything irreversible: deleting files, branches, cloud resources; DNS; branch protection.

Never reset, check out, stash or clean uncommitted work. If a task conflicts with uncommitted changes, stop and ask.

## 4. Branches, commits and PRs

- Branches: `dksk/<type>/<name>`, lowercase kebab-case, type one of `feat fix bugfix refactor chore docs test update`. Check: `^dksk/(feat|fix|bugfix|refactor|chore|docs|test|update)/[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`.
- **One branch and one PR per milestone**, into `main`, with **one commit per task**: imperative subject, a body that says why.
- When several tasks' changes share a file, split commits by hunk (`git add -p`) so each commit is one task; the owner approves each.
- **Every commit typechecks on its own**, so any commit can be checked out, bisected or reverted. Plan the split so each commit carries what it needs (a type with its first use, a migration with its query). After the owner's commits, check each one in a throwaway worktree, which leaves the working tree alone: `git worktree add ../check <sha>`, `ln -s "$PWD/node_modules" ../check/node_modules`, `pnpm --dir ../check typecheck`, then `git worktree remove ../check`. If a commit can't typecheck alone, say so before the push and suggest merging it with the next one.
- PR description: summary, a few JPEG screenshots from `qa-tester` (never PNG), what changed (one line per commit), how to verify (`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm doctor`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`), checklist, and the compare URL.
- `code-reviewer` before every commit.

## 5. Status: one place only

| File | Job | Updated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | **The only status source:** dashboard (Now, Next, Waiting on the owner, Released), queue (the **Status column comes right after #**, so status is the first thing read), task details, owner decisions, risks, log | After every task |
| `docs/GUIDE.md` | **Reference:** what the product does, features with stable F-IDs and a State line, architecture, setup | Only when behaviour, permissions, routes or setup change |
| `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` | Design rules and the owner's feedback (§22) | When a rule changes or the owner gives feedback |
| `CLAUDE.md` | What every agent reads first | When conventions change |

Never copy status into the guide, `CLAUDE.md`, PR text or issues; link to the roadmap instead. Feature IDs are permanent. "Implemented" isn't "released": released means merged, migrated and deployed.

## 6. Briefing an agent

A good brief makes the agent right the first time (rework is the biggest waste):

- The task's roadmap row and its "Done when" criteria, copied.
- The 3–8 files to read, with line ranges where possible; point to docs instead of pasting them.
- What **not** to touch (other agents' areas, uncommitted work, `src/components/ui/`).
- Design notes from `product-designer` for UI work.
- The checks to run and what to report (file paths, results, anything left or risky).
- Model: the strongest for building, design, security, migrations, debugging; mid-size only for mechanical work (QA checklists, doc edits); see `credits-optimizer`.

## 7. Handoff after a context reset

Read in this order, then continue the active task:

1. `docs/GUIDE.md` (what the product is)
2. `docs/ROADMAP.md` (dashboard, the active task, waiting on the owner)
3. `CLAUDE.md` (conventions)
4. `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` before any UI work
5. `git status --short` and `git log --oneline -10`

Before stopping work, leave the roadmap current: what's done, what's half done (with file paths), what's next, what needs the owner. A future session must be able to continue from the roadmap alone.

## 8. Quality and credits

- **Quality first.** Credits efficiency means cutting waste, never quality. Keep: design first where UI needs it, research before big UI work, review and QA after every build, accessibility, tests, the strongest model for building.
- Waste to cut: rework from unclear briefs, re-reading whole trees, repeated full test runs (focused while working, full once at the end), oversized briefs, parallel edits that collide, screenshots.
- **Never PNG.** Text checks first (DOM text, roles, computed styles, overflow, axe, console). Screenshots only when text can't tell or the owner needs to see it (PR screenshots), as JPEG quality 60 with CSS scale, a few per task.
- No demo artifacts or long reports unless the owner asks.

## 9. Seed and demo data

- **Real, public content only.** Seed and demo data come from real public sources that fit the product (public docs, handbooks, open data, published policies), with the source noted in the seed file. Never invented filler ("Lorem ipsum", "Test item 3", made-up companies or people): it hides layout problems, and the owner judges the app on it. Never real personal data.
- **One seed, safe to re-run.** Seeds are idempotent (`INSERT OR IGNORE` / `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` with fixed ids), so running them twice changes nothing ([`BACKEND_CLOUDFLARE.md` §2](./BACKEND_CLOUDFLARE.md#seeds-and-demo-accounts)). Local and demo only, never production.
- **A demo account per role**, pre-filled on the sign-in page as one-click buttons when `DEMO_MODE` is on (local and demo only). QA signs in as each role through them.
- Resetting local data and re-seeding needs the owner's OK (it wipes their test data).

## 10. Lessons from earlier projects

| What happened | Rule it produced |
| --- | --- |
| Several features (design pass, review queue, AI drafts, an extension, reports) were built by agents **in parallel**; simultaneous edits to shared files **broke the local app**. | One build agent at a time, in the roadmap's order. Read-only agents (reviewers) may run alongside. |
| Status was kept in **two docs**; they drifted, and nobody could tell what was released. | `ROADMAP.md` is the only status source; `GUIDE.md` is reference only, with a State line per feature. |
| A large uncommitted working tree built up across many tasks. | One commit per task, approved by the owner as tasks finish; split by hunk when files are shared. |
| PNG screenshots used up credits fast. | Text checks first; JPEG quality 60 only, few. |
| Migrations that rewrote data (a table becoming a view) were risky to run remotely. | Back up first, test on a production-like copy, keep migrations backward compatible. |
| Feature requests arrived mid-task and work got interleaved. | New requests go to the end of the queue unless the owner says otherwise. |
| The owner's visual feedback was given once and then forgotten by later sessions. | Record it in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §22 the same day; every agent reads it. |
| Status was hard to scan because it sat at the end of each queue row. | The Status column comes right after # in the roadmap queue. |
| "Save credits" was read as "do less", and work had to be redone. | Credits efficiency cuts waste (rework, re-reads, repeated runs, images), never quality or the strongest model for building. |
| Commits split by hunk didn't build on their own, so one couldn't be reverted alone. | Every commit typechecks on its own; check each split before suggesting it (§4). |
| Invented demo data ("Test item 3") hid layout problems and looked fake to the owner. | Seed and demo data from real public content (§9). |
| Testing each role meant creating accounts by hand every time. | A pre-filled demo account per role behind `DEMO_MODE` (§9). |
| A big screen was designed from scratch, then redone after the owner compared it with familiar tools. | Research competitors and familiar tools before big UI work (`RESEARCH.md`). |
| Agents ran commits, deploys or data resets the owner hadn't approved. | The approval list in §3; agents suggest commands, the owner says go. |
